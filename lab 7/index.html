        <h1> Lab7: Functions </h1>
        <p> Working with my partner, experiment wit basic
          Arrays and Objects. </p>

        <h2> Challenges </h2>
        <p> A new challenge that I faced in Lab 7, was creating the folders and
          files in Atom. Since previously it was always provided for us, I had
          to recall how to do it on my own. </p>

        <h2> Problems </h2>
        <p> I am also still getting used to JavaScript so that was a problem that
          I encountered and needed to look back on the slides to recall some
          commands and functions. </p>

        <h2> Results </h2>
        <p> I resolved my challenges and problems by attending section and asking
        how to create files and folders in Atom. I had to simply right click
      on my Lab 7 folder and create sub folders with the correct names. </p>

	<h1> Challenge </h1>

	<p>
		The challenge for this lab was understanding the requirements and forced me to slow down
		and write the pseodocode before jumping into coding a game. I am also still getting used to Atom
		so that is always a challenge.

	<div class-"problem">
	<h1> Problem </h1>
	<p>
		The problem was trying to put the author block in js file. The file was already created for us
		but I wanted to learn the process on my own so I spent some time trying to create a js file on my own.
	</p>

	<div class-"result">
	<h1> Result </h1>
	<p>
		I was able to create a js file and from there I followed the lab instructions and added the
		tags to my index file so that HTML does not collapse it. I then added all my files onto my google <!DOCTYPE html>
		with my partner.

		<h1> Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks </h1>
    <p> Working with my partner, experiment wit basic
      Arrays and Objects. </p>

    <h2> Challenges </h2>
    <p> A new challenge that I faced in Lab 7, was creating the folders and
      files in Atom. Since previously it was always provided for us, I had
      to recall how to do it on my own. </p>

    <h2> Problems </h2>
    <p> I am still experimenting within the console and getting used to different
    functions but at this point I am getting comfortable with Atom and executing
  my code the way I planned it. </p>

    <h2> Results </h2>
    <p> I resolved my challenges and problems by attending section and followed
    the lab instructions. </p>

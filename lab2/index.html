<h1> Hello World </h1>

<p> My name is Yasmin Kashani. I am a Computer Science major and I am a third year here at UCSC. <br>
My partner is Jackie Castro and we worked great together and communicated well to finish the lab. <br> She enjoys drawing and a fun fact about her is that she is a triplet. </p>
